						VICTORIA -- In what might be a nightmare scenario for some, 10 students at the University of Victoria were stuck in an elevator on campus for more than an hour and a half Wednesday night.

							According to campus security, a call came in at 10:10 p.m. saying the students were stuck in an elevator in the Bob Wright Centre, the university's ocean sciences building.
							
							Security attended the scene at 10:16 p.m. and found the elevator stuck on the fifth floor displaying an electronic out-of-service message.
							
							
							Campus security determined that none of the students were in medical distress and then called a maintenance contractor.
							
							While security remained on site, the contractor attended to the issue at 11:49 p.m. and was able to quickly release the students trapped in the elevator.
							
							The contractor is repairing the elevator Thursday morning, according to the university.
							
						
					
		        		The University of Victoria has more than 100 elevators and lifting devices and says that issues such as stuck elevators are rare.. </p>

			(Bloomberg) -- Kone Oyj handed in the highest offer for Thyssenkrupp AG’s elevator business, as the Finnish company tries to outbid buyout firms by a wide enough margin to overcome antitrust concerns, people with knowledge of the matter said.

			Kone, which has teamed up with CVC Capital Partners, offered around 17 billion euros ($18.7 billion) this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. Kone confirmed in a statement Tuesday that it made
		    a non-binding bid for Thyssenkrupp’s elevator unit that’s “reasonably close to the value circulating in the media.”
			
			The Kone consortium’s goal has been to outbid its private equity rivals by at least 1 billion euros, the people said. Thyssenkrupp might push for even more from the bidder group, according the people.
			
			Kone has also given Thyssenkrupp the option of receiving all cash or a mix of cash and stock, the people said. It has offered to fully assume any antitrust risks and aims to address concerns by handing Thyssenkrupp’s elevator operations in Europe, where there is the most overlap, over to CVC, according to the people.
			
			The pair has also offered a multibillion-euro upfront payment that Thyssenkrupp would keep even if the deal is blocked by competition authorities, the people said. Shares of Thyssenkrupp jumped as much as 8% in Tuesday afternoon trading. They closed 5.3% higher, giving the company a market value of 7.3 billion euros.

			Broken elevators in the Clinical Services Building at Royal Inland Hospital have led to major changes to access and parking at the Columbia Street medical facility — changes that are expected to remain in place until the end of the month.

			Interior Health said an unexpected equipment failure has placed elevators out of commission, leaving visitors accessing the Clinical Services Building on Columbia Street to face five flights of stairs. As a result, the health authority is advising visitors who have difficulty climbing stairs to plan ahead and consider alternate methods of access.

	At least four elevator malfunctions occurred this past week on both the Beren and Wilf Campuses, affecting numerous students and faculty members and disrupting class schedules. In at least one incident, 911 was called and the FDNY responded to physically break university staff out of a broken elevator. 

	At approximately 9 a.m. Thursday morning, four Beren students, one faculty member and a maintenance worker were stuck in an elevator on the seventh floor of Stanton Hall for a few minutes before elevator personnel forcefully pried open the door and rescued them. An hour and a half later, a large group of Beren students, as well as a faculty member, were taking the elevator from the tenth floor to the lobby of Stanton Hall when it abruptly stopped on the seventh floor. They were rescued by elevator personnel after approximately five minutes.
	
	At the time, two out of the three elevators in Stanton Hall were already broken, leaving students with no other choice but to take the third, faulty elevator. “It reflects poorly on the institution,” shared a frustrated professor who started class 15 minutes late because of the Stanton Hall elevator malfunctions. “Professors and students can’t get to class on time because the elevators are so crappy. It’s a schande on the university.” He suggested that students “do a one-day walkout” to urge the university to properly take care of elevator-related issues on campus.
	
	“It was a pretty inconvenient experience, but thank God I’m appreciative of the maintenance crew that helped us out,” shared Talya Hyman (SCW ‘20), one of the students who was stuck in the elevator during the second incident on Thursday.
	
	Earlier in the week, The Commentator learned that Men’s Undergraduate Torah Studies (UTS) Dean Rabbi Yosef Kalinsky and UTS Academic Adviser Rabbi Willie Balk were rescued by New York City firefighters from a Glueck elevator. The rescue occurred on the sixth floor of the Jacob and Dreizel Glueck Center for Jewish Studies a little after 5 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 27, and was confirmed by a number of faculty bystanders. According to a comment from Rabbi Balk on his Facebook post about the incident, the rabbis were freed from the elevator after 25 minutes. Rabbis Kalinsky and Balk both confirmed the incident to The Commentator but did not comment further. 
	
	These incidents follow the FDNY’s rescue of seven students from a malfunctioning elevator in Morgenstern Residence Hall on Thursday, Jan. 23, as The Commentator previously reported. Following that incident, Randy Apfelbaum, Chief Facilities & Administrative Officer at YU, apologized for the malfunction in a statement to The Commentator.
	
	Throughout this week, elevators in many buildings on YU’s Wilf and Beren Campuses have been malfunctioning or breaking. On Monday night, one student was rescued from an elevator in the Mendel Gottesman Library on the Wilf Campus after he called security when the doors failed to open. At one point on Tuesday afternoon, the sixteen-story Belfer Hall reportedly was left with no operating elevators after all three of its elevators were broken or being repaired. An email to Wilf Campus students and faculty on Wednesday evening from YU Operations informed students that all Belfer elevators were back in service. Beren students have reportedly not received any emails regarding the elevator incidents from YU’s administration over the last week, despite the numerous malfunctions that have occurred on the Beren Campus.
	
	“It shouldn't take multiple incidents of people getting stuck on elevators for someone to realize that we should probably just gut the whole infrastructure and repair everything,” said Matthew Silkin (YC ‘20). “Any other institution would have started on this months ago. Why the university still hasn't done anything is frankly baffling.”
	
	A number of other hazardous elevator incidents have occurred recently, including a concussion incurred by Shifra Lindenberg (SSSB ‘21) after a Brookdale elevator allegedly went into a “free-fall” last May. In November, a Stanton Hall elevator reportedly fell three floors before stopping abruptly with a student inside.

	HALIFAX, N.S. — A grievance concerning an elevator builder accused of being high on the job turned out to be an open and shut case.
	Ryan Prime was part of a two-man team installing elevators in a new seniors complex in Hammonds Plains when he was accused last October
	 of smoking weed one morning before work.
	
	He was terminated from his job with Kone, Inc. for breaching its drug and alcohol policy by allegedly smoking marijuana.
	
	Prime’s union grieved the dismissal, and arbitrator Eric Slone ruled in Prime’s favour on Saturday after holding a hearing last week.
	
	“Elevator construction is dangerous work, and there is no place for employees whose faculties are impaired by intoxicants, whether 
	they are legally available or not. Such a person would be a risk to himself, his co-workers and other people who might be present 
	at the time,” Slone wrote in his decision. “On the other hand, an individual who is accused of being in breach of such a policy,
	 with the serious career and financial consequences that it brings, is entitled to have the case against him proved properly.”
